# Melba-Toaster

This is the presentation part of NOM Network's VTuber **Melba Toast**.

Written in Godot, this program allows the Melba Toast model to speak, show animations, have expressions and such, driven by the backend. Includes the Control Panel.

Communication with the backend follows [this API schema](API_SCHEMA.md).

## How to use

1. Install the latest minor version of [Godot 4.1](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/) (we are currently using [4.1.3 RC1](https://godotengine.org/article/release-candidate-godot-4-1-3-rc-1/#downloads)).

2. Clone this repo via Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NOM-Network/Melba-Toaster.git
    ```

    Alternatively, you can Download ZIP package using the green "Code" button and unzip it.

3. In the `config` folder, duplicate `prod.cfg.example` file, rename it to `prod.cfg` and fill it out with the connection details for both OBS and backend websockets (make sure they are available).

4. Open the project in Godot.

5. Hit F5 in Godot editor. Live2D and Control Panel scenes will start automatically.

> The project can run without OBS and/or the backend, but nothing will actually happen. You can find a [mock backend server](backend/README.md) in the `backend` folder.

### Note for Mac/Linux users

This project uses already built DLLs for Cubism extension. If you need to use Toaster on Mac or Linux, you have to [build the libraries](https://github.com/MizunagiKB/gd_cubism/blob/main/doc/BUILD.en.adoc#build-for-macos), then put them in `addons\gd_cubism\bin` folder.
