# Toaster

This is the presentation part of NOM Network's AI VTuber **[Melba Toast](https://www.twitch.tv/melbathetoast/)**.

Written using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and GDScript, this program allows Melba Toast's model to speak, show animations, have expressions and such, driven by the backend. Includes the Control Panel, which can be used to drive the model, OBS Studio and moderate incoming speech. Also includes Greenscreen mode for streaming via Discord or other services to 3rd party.

Communication with the backend follows [this API schema](API_SCHEMA.md).

**Control panel interface**

## Development

1. Install the latest minor version of Godot 4.2:

    - standalone: <https://godotengine.org/download/windows/>
    - via winget:

    ```powershell
    winget install GodotEngine.GodotEngine
    ```

2. Clone this repo via Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NOM-Network/Melba-Toaster.git
    ```

    Alternatively, you can Download ZIP package using the green "Code" button and unzip it.

3. In the `config` folder, duplicate `prod.cfg.example` file, rename it to `prod.cfg` and fill it out with the connection details for both OBS and backend websockets (make sure they are available).

4. Open the project in Godot.

5. Hit F5 in Godot editor. Live2D and Control Panel scenes should start automatically.

> The project can run without OBS and/or the backend, but nothing will actually happen. You can find a [mock backend server](backend/README.md) in the `backend` folder.
>
> When pushing changes to the repository, ignore or revert any `Param` changes in `scenes\live2d\live_2d_melba.tscn` - they are control parameters for the model and are changed in the runtime. If you use GitHub Desktop, you can ignore these lines from commit by clicking on the line block.
